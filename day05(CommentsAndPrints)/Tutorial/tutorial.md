Day 5 - Comments, Escape sequence & Print in Python

Today we will talk about Comments, Escape Sequences and little bit more about print statement in Python. We will also throw some light on Escape Sequences

Python Comments

A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing.

Single-Line Comments:

To write a comment just add a ‘#’ at the start of the line.

Example 1

#This is a 'Single-Line Comment'

print("This is a print statement.")

Multi-Line Comments:

To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line or you can use the multiline string.

Example 1: The use of ‘#’.

#It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

#If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code.

p = 7

if (p > 5):

    print("p is greater than 5.")

else:

    print("p is not greater than 5.")
    
Output:

p is greater than 5.
